# Project Overview

This project aims to explore and understand the reasons behind candidates not attending their scheduled appointments with companies after applying for job positions. Despite receiving appointment offers, a significant portion of candidates fail to show up. The project seeks to answer the critical question: Why do candidates not attend their appointments, and what can be done to improve attendance rates?

## Structure of the Workspace

The workspace is organized into several key components essential for conducting a thorough analysis:


- **analysis_script.py**: A Python script that contains a clean and executable version of the analysis performed in the Jupyter Notebook. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis steps.
- **notebooks/**: Contains a Jupyter Notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) that details the analysis process step-by-step, including visualizations and explanations.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python libraries required to run the project. This file facilitates easy installation of dependencies for anyone looking to run the project.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project is to identify the factors contributing to the high no-show rate among candidates who receive appointment offers from companies. By analyzing the data and identifying patterns, the project aims to provide insights into:

1. The reasons behind candidates not attending their appointments.
2. Potential strategies that companies can implement to encourage candidates to attend their appointments.

## Technologies Used

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
